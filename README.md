Spaceports
==========

Geocoded list of world's spaceports.

Data columns:
`Designation	Address	Country	Main nationality	Open	Closed	Operators	website	lat	lon`

These fields are not always easy to assess; for example `Open` should be the date of first spatial/suborbital launch (in the future if it is aonly  project). `Nationality` is also difficult to assess in the case of multi-state or multi-national private endeavours. More work needs TDB on that front.

# TODO

- check all dates (should be first spatial launch date, not airport creation date)
- add [Puerto Rico Spaceport](http://langkasa-norul.blogspot.no/2013_09_01_archive.html)
